### A quick message to the reader

This post is the product of working the past two long years, at two large companies, in 
two different countries and in two different sectors. If you expect to learn something
profound reading this, I can almost assure you that you will not. My motivation is 
only to put my frustrations to writing and to state my case against remote work. I am of
the opinion that years from now, when scholars are studying the collapse of civilization
as it is today, they will most certainly attribute our fall, at least in part, to social 
media and remote work. Today I will focus on the latter of the two topics as it is a subject
near and dear to my heart.

### The context

I thought COVID-19 would be over within a few weeks. God was I wrong. Despite
the fact that I am not wearing a mask this week (I did have to wear one in a meeting
only last week), there has been a fundamental shift to the way we live life and conduct
business in this semi-post COVID world. One of those fundamental shifts has been the 
normalization of remote work (known as télétravail in my new home country). I know, it
sounds like a dream come true. On _Hacker News_ I frequently read individuals touting
their great productivity while working remotely. They were never as productive before
as they are now, sitting or lounging wherever they are, away from their colleagues and
their stuffy offices while checking their morning emails. Perhaps this is entirely true,
I really do not know. I can only speak to how it has felt working onsite for the past
few years while many of my colleagues opted to work remotely. Maybe my experiences, being
on the receiving end of remote work are unique, but I doubt this is the case.

### In the beginning

When the stay-at-home orders were initially issued, my employer was deemed an essential
entity and therefore continued to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. My son was about 
to be born and I was fortunate to be provided with paternity leave as a father. 
Of course I took every bit of the time off and then some. Most of my time off was to 
help my wife with the kids (especially my son who seemed to not sleep) but I also did 
not want to go to work. Little was known about COVID at the time, and I would check daily, 
with impending doom, how many more little red dots had appeared near me on the Johns Hopkins 
COVID dashboard. In the end, my paid time off was running low and I decided that it was high time to 
return to work. I was an engineer but my position also placed me in direct supervision of approximately 
15 people who were required to be onsite. Due to my position, HR gave me the option to
work remotely. While the offer was tempting, I do not believe I would have, nor should have been
respected by my direct reports. If they had to be onsite, I should be onsite. And so I went...

### Insult to injury

I had two offices on different floors. Prior to the pandemic, I would frequently occupy
the office which would allow me to focus on my work with the fewest amount of interruptions.
I promise that I was not shirking my responsibilities, but aside from my day-to-day
duties I also worked on many projects which required some quiet and my undivided attention.
Now, with the pandemic in full swing, I did not have to play hide-and-seek to focus
on my work, everything was quiet... in fact too quiet.

Since I had been out for over a month (I _had_ been in frequent contact with my team by phone
and via email), I spent my first day or two checking in on my team. How were they doing?
How were their families? How has work been? This final question illicited the most responses
and complaints. It seems that practically no one from management had been onsite since the stay 
at home order was issued (about one month). The only form of communication was coming in the
form of an email sent every few days from HR and upper management to the building. These emails
would announce the latest butcher's bill of COVID positive individuals in the building. 
Accompanying these numbers was always a message to remind everyone that their safety was the
companies number one priority. This message seemed to be the root of most ill feelings
amongst those of us onsite (myself included). The same individuals ensuring that the factory doors 
stayed open, that money continued to roll in and that our earnings and stock continued to grow. 
Given the backdrop of everything happening, the messaging did feel disengenuous. To this day I
shudder thinking about those emails. If this was really the case, everyone would be home, right?
But, I digress. This post is not about distasteful emails but remote work and apparently most, if not 
all of management, including engineering was doing just that.. working remotely.

### Radio silence

Initially, the quiet was a welcome reprieve from the typical chaos which permeated our factory.
I had a number of ideas in my time away from work that I wanted to bring to life and the
silence allowed me to do just that. I quickly noticed that when I did need to send an email to
a colleague, that responses were not as punctual as they seemed to have been before the stay-at-home.
Maybe it was just me? At the time, I asked myself this question (I am not the most patient 
individual in the world), but today I am convinced otherwise. The more and more I needed an answer 
from planning, product engineering, from other engineers, the more I came to the realization that people 
could not really be on their computers, logged in doing real *work*, all day. They just couldn't. 
Many of my requests were critical to customers receiving their semiconductors on time. As an example,
our planning department had the capability of flagging wafer lots as a priority. A wafer lot with a priority
flag of zero was the highest priority, then priority one and finally priority two. Typically, priority
wafer lots were closely monitored and if placed on hold for more than 30 minutes, phones would begin to
ring asking why the lot was not being processed. We had rules on the books about this very topic. I was
at the very end of our factory flow in the probe and test area, so I spoke frequently with planning and
would field their phone almost calls every morning. These phone calls stopped coming in almost completely.
One morning I returned after a long weekend to find a priority zero lot had been on hold for longer than 
72 hours and no one seemed to care. No emails, no phone calls, nothing... The 30 minute rule which was
sacrosanct was being violated and nothing... Radio silence.

I could share a laundry list of examples similar to this, but I will not. I assure you that there
were many many more. Needless to say that if I could feel the lack of support from all of leadership
in my company, so could my direct reports. After a few months of this radio silence, my wife and I
decided to take the children and relocate to France. My wife is French, so this was not a random choice.
Other factors in our decision were, my wife has a large family in France (our daughter is severely handicapped
so the family support is a great help), the area of France we were moving to (now live in) is much safer
than Dallas, Texas for my children to grow up in, and finally, I realized that my work was just that, work.
I was payed very well, I was given the tools to create great things and was left alone for the most part
to be autonomous, but it really didn't feel like anyone cared anymore. So, after some introspection I decided
that money isn't everything and why not take the plunge and move. I will find another job where people
are engaged and passionate about what they do. So we sold the house, shipped our belongings across
the Atlantic and moved.
