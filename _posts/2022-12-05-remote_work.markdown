### A quick message to the reader

This post is the product of working the past two long years, at two large companies, in 
two different countries and in two different sectors. If you expect to learn something
profound reading this, I can almost assure you that you will not. My motivation is 
only to put my frustrations to writing and to state my case against remote work. I am of
the opinion that years from now, when scholars are studying the collapse of civilization
as it is today, they will most certainly attribute our fall, at least in part, to social 
media and remote work. Today I will focus on the latter of the two topics as it is a subject
near and dear to my heart.

### The context

I thought COVID-19 would be over within a few weeks. God was I wrong. Despite
the fact that I am not wearing a mask this week (I did have to wear one in a meeting
only last week), there has been a fundamental shift to the way we live life and conduct
business in this semi-post COVID world. One of those fundamental shifts has been the 
normalization of remote work (known as télétravail in my new home country). I know, it
sounds like a dream come true. On _Hacker News_ I frequently read individuals touting
their great productivity while working remotely. They were never as productive before
as they are now, sitting or lounging wherever they are, away from their colleagues and
their stuffy offices while checking their morning emails. Perhaps this is entirely true,
I really do not know. I can only speak to how it has felt working onsite for the past
few years while many of my colleagues opted to work remotely. Maybe my experiences, being
on the receiving end of remote work are unique, but I doubt this is the case.

### In the beginning

When the stay-at-home orders were initially issued, my employer was deemed an essential
entity and therefore continued to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. My son was about 
to be born and I was fortunate to be provided with paternity leave as a father. 
Of course I took every bit of the time off and then some. Most of my time off was to 
help my wife with the kids (especially my son who seemed to not sleep) but I also did 
not want to go to work. Little was known about COVID at the time, and I would check daily, 
with impending doom, how many more little red dots had appeared near me on the Johns Hopkins 
COVID dashboard. In the end, my paid time off was running low and I decided that it was high time to 
return to work. I was an engineer but my position also placed me in direct supervision of approximately 
15 people who were required to be onsite. Due to my position, HR gave me the option to
work remotely. While the offer was tempting, I do not believe I would have, nor should have been
respected by my direct reports. If they had to be onsite, I should be onsite. And so I went...

### Insult to injury

I had two offices on different floors. Prior to the pandemic, I would frequently occupy
the office which would allow me to focus on my work with the fewest amount of interruptions.
I promise that I was not shirking my responsibilities, but aside from my day-to-day
duties I also worked on many projects which required some quiet and my undivided attention.
Now, with the pandemic in full swing, I did not have to play hide-and-seek to focus
on my work, everything was quiet... in fact too quiet.

Since I had been out for over a month (I _had_ been in frequent contact with my team by phone
and via email), I spent my first day or two checking in on my team. How were they doing?
How were their families? How has work been? This final question illicited the most responses
and complaints. It seems that practically no one from management had been onsite since the stay 
at home order was issued (about one month). The only form of communication was coming in the
form of an email sent every few days from HR and upper management to the building. These emails
would announce the latest butcher's bill of COVID positive individuals in the building. 
Accompanying these numbers was always a message to remind everyone that their safety was the
companies number one priority. This message seemed to be the root of most ill feelings
amongst those of us onsite (myself included). The same individuals ensuring that the factory doors 
stayed open, that money continued to roll in and that our earnings and stock continued to grow. 
Given the backdrop of everything happening, the messaging did feel disengenuous. To this day I
shudder thinking about those emails. If this was really the case, everyone would be home, right?
But, I digress. This post is not about distasteful emails but remote work and apparently most, if not 
all of management, including engineering was doing just that.. working remotely.

### Of course they will respond to my emails, they are working remotely. Right?

More will be added to this tomorrow.
