## Motivation

For years, I have been using numerous different databases on an almost daily basis. Oracle, PostgreSQL, MariaDB,
InfluxDB, etc.. etc.. I enjoy the challenge of writing complex queries and discovering patterns or trends in the results. 
I believe that most individuals in a business setting should be familiar with SQL (though this is far from reality). 
I am also well aware that databases are not the only place that data can be extracted. Some other data sources include:

1. Web scraping
2. Flat files (excel, csv, json)
3. Logs

I am familiar wth all the sources names in this list with the exception of logs. Have I looked at or seen logs? Of course
I have. I still refer to my *dmesg* log if I have a file system or device mounting issue. I have used numerous
apache/httpd logs to troubleshoot *WSGI* applications. But, both of these cases have never merited me learning to use something
like a log aggregator. Until now. For the first time in my professional career, I have found the need to extract log data
which is not available anywhere else except in a mountain of logs. More specifically, logs generated by automation systems.
Since I have read about various solutions for successfully analyzing log data in the past, I have decided to use this
opportunity to test drive some of these solutions. I will not be using the automation logs already mentioned above
for this post, but I will be using various sytems logs to better understand the tooling and log aggregate capabilities
in general.

## Grafana Loki
