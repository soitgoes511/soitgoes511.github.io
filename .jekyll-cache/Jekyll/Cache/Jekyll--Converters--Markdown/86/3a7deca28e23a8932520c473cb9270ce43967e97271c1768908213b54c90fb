I"Z<p>I will keep this short and sweet. I left corporate life in America to move to my wifeâ€™s home country, <strong>France</strong>. I have worked in the <em>semiconductor industry</em> for about 4 years as an 
<em>engineer</em> in various roles. My background at University was <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> with a concentration in microelectronics. My employer treated me well and paid me better. I had 
a real career. About 3.5 years ago my beautiful daughter was born. My wife and I were informed at our 20 week sonogram that there were issues. Our life has never been the same since.</p>
