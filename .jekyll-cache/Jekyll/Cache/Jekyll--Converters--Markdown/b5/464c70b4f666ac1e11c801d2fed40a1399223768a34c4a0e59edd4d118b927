I"o<p>I will keep this short and sweet. I left corporate life in <strong>America</strong> to move to my wifeâ€™s home country, <strong>France</strong>. I had worked in the <em>semiconductor industry</em> for about 4 years as 
an <em>engineer</em> in various roles. My background at University was <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> with a concentration in microelectronics. My employer treated me well and finances were good. 
I had a real career. About 3.5 years ago my beautiful daughter was born. My wife and I were informed at our 20 week sonogram that there were issues. Our life has never been the same 
since.</p>
