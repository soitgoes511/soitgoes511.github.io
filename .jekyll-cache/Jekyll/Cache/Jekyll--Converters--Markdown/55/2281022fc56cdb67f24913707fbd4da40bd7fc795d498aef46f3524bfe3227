I"s<p>I will keep this short and sweet. I left corporate life in <strong>America</strong> to move to my wife’s home country, <strong>France</strong>. I had worked in the <em>semiconductor industry</em> for about 4 years as 
an <em>engineer</em> in various roles. My background at University was <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong> with a concentration in microelectronics. My employer treated me well and finances were good. 
I had a real career. About 3.5 years ago my beautiful daughter was born. My wife and I were informed at our 20 week sonogram that there were issues. Our life has never been the same 
since.</p>

<p>I have been through plenty of hard times in my life, but to this day, seeing her struggles has really darkened my soul. We came to France so her and my son could be with family. We
came to France so they could be loved. We are only here on this earth for a brief moment and like <em>Bob Marley</em> said so wonderfully:</p>

<p>This is my first blog entry. I promise that I will delve into some fun projects down the road. I am waiting until we purchase our house to nerd out on some <strong>IOT and pub-sub messaging
systems</strong>. If you read this, thank you. :grin:</p>
