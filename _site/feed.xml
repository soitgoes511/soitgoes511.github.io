Perhaps I am being un-realistic considering
I am a beginner in the French language. I could not imagine finding a job in
the states and not speaking English. :crossed_fingers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;some-observations-&quot;&gt;Some observations …&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first observation is that most positions in the fields I am looking for are
looking for Master’s or PHd’s. I guess when university doesn’t cost $100k for
an undergraduate degree :moneybag:, there is more motivation to go a step further. I find myself
regretting not sticking it out for my Master’s but that ship has sailed. At least
I have experience in industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My second observation is that Electrical Engineering degrees here do not translate
to the same studies in the US. I could be wrong and I will have a better perspective
on this very shortly. I have noticed quite a bit of variation in EE degrees in the US, 
too. I have friends which never studied transistors at their schools. We were drowned in
small signal models, large signal models, BJT’s, MOSFET’s, etc.. After long
discussions with my wife in the past, my understanding is that the French University
system is, for the most part, standardized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the second observation above :point_up:, there will probably be some
ambiguity for potential employers. I am attempting to find a career in big data,
data science, data engineering, analytics, web development, etc.. Not sure if that
aligns even remotely with what their EE’s learn at University, but it is not a huge
leap from my past curriculum and studies. Only time will tell. It has only been
2 weeks since I set foot on French soil and I need to be patient and keep plugging away.
On the bright side, in the meantime, I can spend time with my family. I never would 
have had this much time with my children had we stayed in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

I left corporate life in &lt;strong&gt;America&lt;/strong&gt; to move to my wife’s home country, &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt;. I had worked in the &lt;em&gt;semiconductor industry&lt;/em&gt; for about 4 years as 
an &lt;em&gt;engineer&lt;/em&gt; in various roles. My background at University was &lt;strong&gt;Electrical Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; with a concentration in microelectronics. My employer treated me well and finances were good. 
I had a real career. About 3.5 years ago my beautiful daughter was born. My wife and I were informed at our 20 week sonogram that there were issues. Our life has never been the same 
since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been through plenty of hard times in my life, but to this day, seeing her struggles has really darkened my soul. We came to France so her and my son could be with family. We
came to France so they could be loved. We are only here on this earth for a brief moment and like &lt;em&gt;Bob Marley&lt;/em&gt; said so wonderfully:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“…life is worth much more than gold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog entry. I promise that I will delve into some fun projects down the road. I am waiting until we purchase our house to nerd out on some &lt;strong&gt;IOT and pub-sub messaging
systems&lt;/strong&gt;. If you read this, thank you. :grin:&lt;/p&gt;
